# Traveling Companions

In this activity, you will use data that was gathered from Tourism Malaysia, examine the averages of each column and reduce the DataFrame to include only types of companion travelers that are above 1% across all three years. Then you will create a chart to visualize a comparison of travelers to Malaysia from different countries of origin over three years.

## Instructions

* Your instructor will determine if you should use `travel.ipynb` or `travel_extended.ipynb` for your starter file. The first notebook asks you to read in a single CSV file, whereas the extended notebook provides you with the code to merge three CSV files to produce the same DataFrame.

* Check the comments in each cell of the starter file for activity instructions.

* Your final DataFrame should align with the following table:

* Your output chart should align with the following figure, depending on the user’s input variable:
